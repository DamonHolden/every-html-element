# Every HTML Element

This project exists to encapsulate and demonstrate use-cases for all the the current, non-deprecated, HTML elements as specified by current standards.

While all the elements used in this project should should be valid elements sourced from the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), the project directly mirrors the guidance from [MDN's HTML elements reference](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
